# Validation record

This file records the observed build/test/runtime status of the three Sizqo
tracks. Rules: a feature is "supported" only with a command and its real
outcome recorded here; pending or blocked work is never reported as passed.
Update this file whenever a track's capability changes.

| Swift history / backup / pause / queue / settings self-checks | `bash scripts/test_swift_history.sh` | ✅ all pass |

## Track: Direct (`com.misswell.sizqo`)

- Image pipeline: inherited OctoShrink engine, covered by the Rust suites and
  frontend suites above. No regression observed.
- Video pipeline (`src-tauri/src/video/`, `video_commands.rs`):
  - Probe / capability trials / EncodePlan / streaming encode / progress /
    cancellation / validation / transaction are unit-tested (87 unit tests).
  - Software encoder set: x264, x265, SVT-AV1, VP9; containers MP4, MOV,
    MKV, WebM, TS; audio policies copy/AAC/Opus/MP3/FLAC/none. Real runtime
    validation (2026-10-11): VP9+WebM+Opus, x264+TS+MP3, and x264+MKV+FLAC
    encoded with the collected binary, probed correct (format/codec), and
    passed full-decode checks.
  - Real encode end-to-end with the collected runtime (2026-10-11, arm64):
    generated a 1280x720/30fps H.264+AAC 5s MP4 (4.7 MB), re-encoded it with
    the plan-shaped argv (libx264 CRF 28, AAC 160k, `+faststart`) through the
    collected bundled binary; output 937 KB (80% smaller), `ffprobe` reports
    exactly 5.000000 s, and a full `-xerror` decode of the output passed.
  - Full acceptance matrix (AGENTS.md §11, items 1–12 incl. HDR/VFR/multi-track
    fixtures, kill-during-commit recovery, 20 GB sources): **pending** —
    needs real user-accepted fixtures and signed-runtime runs.
- Bundled runtime: `scripts/collect_macos_tools.sh` collects `ffmpeg` 9.0.2 +
  `ffprobe` (Homebrew build, GPL configuration: `--enable-gpl --enable-libx264
  --enable-libx265 --enable-libsvtav1`; encoders verified present in the
  collected copy) into `src-tauri/resources/video/{bin,lib}` (19 dylibs),
  ad-hoc signed so they execute; `scripts/notarize.sh`, `scripts/package.sh`
  and `scripts/video_collect_ffmpeg.sh` stage/verify them. The GPL
  configuration is **not publishable** until the review in
  [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) is done.
- Unsigned build (2026-10-11): `bash scripts/build_all.sh` produced
  `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Sizqo_direct.app` (69 MB); the
  bundled `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`/`pngquant` were executed from inside the built
  `.app` successfully. Signed-runtime check and GUI launch check: **pending**.

## Track: App Store (`com.misswell.sizqo.appstore`)

- Image pipeline: in-process engines build and test under
  `--no-default-features --features inproc-backends`.
- Video: intentionally unavailable at runtime; the capability matrix reports
  the reason instead of showing fake controls
  (`video::capabilities::NATIVE_UNAVAILABLE`). This is the documented,
  accurate runtime-disabled state; no native bridge exists yet.
- Unsigned build (2026-10-11): `bash scripts/build_all.sh` produced
  `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Sizqo.app` (17 MB); verified the
  bundle contains **zero** third-party binaries/dylibs (`Resources/bin`,
  `Resources/lib`, `Resources/video` all absent).
- Signed sandbox runtime check: **pending** (release engineering).

## Track: Swift native (`com.misswell.sizqo.swift`)

- Module renamed `OctoShrinkSwift` → `SizqoSwift`; independent Application
  Support root with `sizqo.`-prefixed settings keys.
- Image functionality: inherited, verified by `scripts/test_swift_history.sh`.
- Build (2026-10-11): `bash scripts/build_swift.sh` produced
  `swift/.build/Sizqo_swift.app` (22 MB, 6 CLI tools + 28 dylibs).
- Video: **not implemented**. No VideoProbe/VideoEncoder exists in
  `swift/Sources/SizqoSwift`; do not advertise video for this track.

## Redesign: intent-first workspace (2026-10-12)

Scope of this change set (all three tracks): the page shell and the operation
model were rebuilt around **intents instead of raw parameters** — left rail
(本轮 / 历史 / 设置), list + detail two-column workspace, persistent run bar;
image intents 肉眼无差优先 / 均衡 / 尽量变小 / 网页尺寸 / 指定体积 / 系统转换 /
自定义, video intents 通用更小 / 高画质·保留轨道 / 指定体积 / 1080p 网页 / 自定义.
The intent → parameter contract lives in
[core/intent-model.md](../core/intent-model.md); the design board in
`docs/UI_DESIGN_MACOS26.html` is marked superseded.

Also fixed in this change set: a compression that converted formats but produced
no smaller valid file used to hand back the **source bytes tagged with the
requested format**, so replace mode could store PNG bytes as `photo.avif` or
write WebP bytes into `photo.png`. The engine now labels such results with the
source format (`kept_original` in `engine.rs` / `engine_inproc.rs`, and the
resized-branch relabel in `settle_working_file`), and replace mode names the
output after the extension its bytes actually have
(`available_converted_path` + the `!same_format` branch in `commands.rs`),
never clobbering an existing file and always after backup + journal.

| Gate | Command | Result |

| New format-label regression tests actually ran | `cargo test --lib -- --exact` per name | ✅ all six ran and passed in all three gates (`commands::tests::{replace_mode_renames_the_file_to_the_format_its_bytes_actually_are, a_format_conversion_never_clobbers_an_existing_file_with_the_target_name, jpg_bytes_overwrite_a_jpeg_source_in_place, a_converted_target_never_overwrites_an_existing_file}`, `engine::intent_tests::{kept_original_labels_the_bytes_with_the_format_they_actually_are, a_settled_run_that_keeps_the_original_reports_the_source_format}`) |
| Rust integration tests | `cargo test` (full, incl. `src-tauri/tests/`) | ⏳ pending — run as part of the release build gate below |
| Frontend suites | `npm run test:frontend` | ✅ EXIT=0 — 17/17 suites |
| Swift module compiles | `xcrun swiftc -typecheck -parse-as-library -target arm64-apple-macos13.0 -module-name SizqoSwift` over the 20 tracked sources (incl. new `Models/ImageIntent.swift`) | ✅ EXIT=0, zero diagnostics; full `-O` codegen also EXIT=0. Note: this track has **no `Package.swift`** — `swift build` cannot be used; the real build entry point is `scripts/build_swift.sh` |
| Swift history / backup / pause / queue / settings self-checks | `bash scripts/test_swift_history.sh` | ✅ EXIT=0 — 32 sections, all `ok`. It compiles a **subset** (not `ImageIntent.swift`, `AppState.swift` or any `Views/`), so it does not gate the intent UI — only the full-app build does |
| Swift `.app` rebuilt this session | `bash scripts/build_swift.sh` | ⏳ not run — that script `rm -rf`s the existing `swift/.build/Sizqo_swift.app` (stale since 2026-10-11) and needs `src-tauri/resources/bin`; the Swift track is not part of this Release |
| GUI / signed-runtime acceptance of the new workspace | launch the built `.app` and drive 本轮/历史/设置 + image/video intents | ⏳ pending — recorded as pending, not passed |
| Three-track build / signing / notarization / §11 video matrix | `bash scripts/build_all.sh`, `bash scripts/notarize.sh` | ⏳ pending per release run below |

## Release: v0.1.0 (2026-10-11)

- Direct DMG `Sizqo-0.1.0-macos.dmg` (31 MB, arm64): Developer ID Application
  "Guofeng Liu (U8U443D7ZL)" signed, notarized (Accepted), stapled, spctl
  accepted. Bundled ffmpeg 9.0.2 configuration recorded in
  [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) with corresponding-source
  links (GPL-2.0-or-later configuration: libx264/libx265 enabled).
- App Store and Swift-native tracks are not part of this release.

## In-app updates (2026-10-11, v0.1.3)

- Independent minisign keypair generated for Sizqo; private key + password
  stored only in the local login keychain (`sizqo-updater-privkey` /
  `sizqo-updater-key-password`), pubkey committed in
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.updater.json`. No OctoShrink key or feed reused.
- `notarize.sh` enables the updater only when the keychain entry exists
  (build merge config + `SIZQO_UPDATER_CONFIGURED=1` + signed
  `Sizqo.app.tar.gz` + `latest.json`); without it the build stays
  updater-disabled.
- Verified: app boots with the plugin registered (config-present +
  registered combination), settings page shows 当前版本 v0.1.3 Direct with
  the 在线更新 row, the public feed endpoint
  `releases/latest/download/latest.json` returns the v0.1.3 feed
  (HTTP 200), and release assets are anonymously downloadable. The actual
  download-and-install path engages from the next release onward.

## Release gate (per [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md))

Before any tag/Release: full three-track build, signed Direct runtime check,
signed sandbox check, real fixture video matrix (AGENTS.md §11 items 1–12),
FFmpeg licensing review. A local commit is not a GitHub push; every published
tag must link its artifacts here with the exact commands used.
